# Vendor-Performance-Analysis


## üìå Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing vendor performance to optimize profitability in the retail and wholesale industry. Using a combination of **MySQL**, **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**, and **Power BI**, the project uncovers inefficiencies in pricing, inventory turnover, and vendor dependencies to provide strategic, data-driven insights.

## üéØ Business Problem

Effective inventory and sales management are essential to prevent losses due to:
- Inefficient pricing strategies
- Poor stock turnover
- High reliance on specific vendors

### Objectives:
- Identify underperforming brands requiring promotional or pricing adjustments.
- Determine top vendors contributing to sales and gross profit.
- Analyze the impact of bulk purchasing on unit costs.
- Assess inventory turnover to reduce holding costs.
- Compare profit margins between high-performing and low-performing vendors.
